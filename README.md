🌟 What's TrashCatcher All About?
TrashCatcher is a humble yet exciting game that I've crafted entirely with Java. It's not just a game; it's a reflection of my "firsts" – my first steps into the realm of game development and my initial encounter with the world of Java programming.

🎮 Game Mechanics
The objective of TrashCatcher is simple: catch the falling trash before it hits the ground! Move your character left and right with the arrow keys, and use your quick reflexes to keep the environment clean and score points. It's a fun and challenging way to dip your toes into game programming.

🛠️ The Tech Behind the Scenes
Language: Java
IDE: Your choice!
Graphics: Java's built-in graphics libraries
Game Loop: Immerse yourself in the classic game loop to keep the action going!
🚀 A Glimpse of My First Java Experience
This project holds a special place in my heart. It's not just about the code; it's about the thrill of learning, experimenting, and creating something from scratch. From setting up the game window to coding the player controls and implementing collision detection, TrashCatcher represents the foundation of my Java programming journey.
